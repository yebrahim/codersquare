# codersquare

A social web app for sharing learning resources in a hackernews-style
experience. I'm building this publicly on my [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ExMy1CBZjmRw0JcocbXKdy271BvWBGq),
contributions are welcome, feel free to send a PR or open an issue.

The stack is Javascript all the way, try cloning this repo, running `npm install` and `npm start` inside the server directory. See the wireframes, PRD
and ERD in the docs directory for the desired experience.

This is an MIT repo that we're using for learning, feel free to fork away and
use as you wish.
